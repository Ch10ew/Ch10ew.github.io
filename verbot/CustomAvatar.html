			<h2>Setting Your Custom Avatar</h2>
			<i>by Rectorez / Kar Hou</i>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>As some may have noticed, Verbot5 in its current state doesn't support additional custom-made avatars due to
			.NET Framework issues.</p>
			<p>While there is no known way of resolving this issue while retaining the current .NET Framework version,
			we can manipulate the existing files in the "Conversive Characters" folder. Specifically, the "julia" character,
			as she is the default file loaded by the Verbot 5 Player.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<th><a>
						<img border="2" width="720" src="img/julia folder.png" alt="A picture showing the julia Folder's directory">
					</a></th>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<td style="text-align:center">
						Folder directory showing the "julia" folder in the "Verbots/Conversive Characters" directory.
					</td>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>Once the "julia" folder has been opened, there should be the "images" folder. Open it and you'll find all of julia's images.
			You'll notice that these are the images you can trigger as julia speaks, such as speech and emotional expressions.
			Another neat thing to note is the fact that some of the pictures are not completely drawn.</p>
